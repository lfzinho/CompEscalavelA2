ROAD



CAR
    init
        save the road
        save car parameters
            the parameters are saved via a template dataclass
            the dataclass contains:
                risk
                speed_min
                speed_max
                acceleration_max
                acceleration_min
                lane_change_prob
        save the car variables
            position (via Position dataclass)
            speed
            collided
        # ideally here we would also create the process and tell it to run
